# Library Management Mobile Application

A Library Management System mobile application manages and stores books information digitally according to student needs. The system helps both the students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It reduces the frequency of students going to library to just enquire about the availability of books and eases the work of a librarian.
